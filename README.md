This project is currently being completey rewitten. (WIP)

A [QuadTree](https://www.i-programmer.info/programming/theory/1679-quadtrees-and-octrees.html)
uses the Hilbert curve and can be explained

# What's New?

The new implmention is more of a Data Orianted Design and uses a struct of Vec's. There is no recusion.

I am now using a [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Heap_implementation) to fine the nodes.
